# yahtzee
Let's play Yahtzee! To start, click "Roll." You have three rolls total. Once you have rolled once, you can click on a dice to hold it before your next roll, then click "Roll" to roll again. After your third roll, click on one of the scoring buttons below to calculate your score. If you have three or four of a certain number, you can score a "three-of-a-kind"  or "four-of-a-kind", respectively, for a score of the total of all of your dice. If you have two of one number, and three of another, you can score 25 points. If you have four consecutive numbers (i.e., 2,3,4,5) you can score 30 points for a small straight. If you have five consecutive numbers (i.e., 1,2,3,4,5) you can score 40 points. If you have a 5-of-a-kind (all the same dice) that's a yahtzee! If you have no other scoring options, click "Chance" to score half the total of  all your dice. Once you finish and score your round, click "Next" to move to the computer's turn. Once the computer's score shows up in their score box, their turn is done, and you can click "Next" to move on to your next turn. After 3 rounds, the player with the most points wins!
